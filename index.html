      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        If you're an art historian, an art novice, or just have an appreciation for art then you know how hard it is to find art online. Currently, the only options are Google or Art Museum catalogs. Art should be readily available and shouldn't be difficult to find. Everyone should be able to view art no matter where they are from or their social circumstance.

      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p class="italic">
        The availability of art should be easily accessed in one place with quality results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to function as a capstone for my schooling at <a  href="www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. This project uses languages and skills that I have learned.

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>
        The process began by finding an API that accesses an art database. Next, began the process of figuring out the features that I wanted to incorporate in this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step in the process was creating mockups (low fidelity) of the site to find a layout that is aesthetically pleasing and functional.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of research was done with existing art museum and art auction websites. This was helpful to figure out layouts and the amount of content I should have on my project. Once a layout was decided the next part was to create create a high fidelity mockup and then  prototype.

      <p>
        The design of the site was to make a feature that has a search feature that will display all art in the database and can be refined due to search parameters set.

        Also, when a user finds a piece that they like I want them to have the ability to find more information about the art or artist. I also wanted to user to have the option to add the the piece of art to a digital gallery where they are able to save and view art that they enjoy.

        There is also a section for featured art pieces and an art trivia game.
